## Gabberwonky - Ian Dilenschneider
*Gabberwonky* is a soundscape composition for the [Gibber](https://gibber.cc) coding language. Utilizing the collaborative "Gabber" feature, many ensemble members are able to live-code in the same environment and execute and run code together. The composition sweeps through rhythmic patterns as different samples are triggered at gradually ascending tempos until they fall into place together.

**Ian Dilenschneider** is a music technology major at Miami University.

## Dihydrogen Monoxide - MULE
1. Steam
2. Water
3. Ice

*Dihydrogen Monoxide* began with a prompt - find or record audio samples that abstractly represent the 3 phases of matter: gas, liquid, and solid. Using a custom digital instrument developed in Max to slice and loop sections of sound, the members of the ensemble explored the different textures, timbres, and internal rhythms of their various samples. The three movements of this piece were composed collaboratively, reflecting on the results after each rehearsal and gradually developing a score that gave structure to the performance while still allowing for individual interpretation and preference for different source material.

## Ghost Ranger - Megan Haarlammert
Inspired by Meganâ€™s affection for the spooky Halloween aesthetic, *Ghost Ranger* is a piece for assorted game controllers and MIDI devices that involves playing traditional music in a non-traditional way. Even though we are well into November, we hope you enjoy this spooky little tune with a touch of Wild West.

**Megan** is a sophomore music technology major and music composition minor from Cincinnati, Ohio. As a competitive ballroom dancer and gymnastics choreographer, as well as a music student, she enjoys writing music, playing music, and curating performances to music. Megan extends her gratitude to members of this ensemble and to the audience for the opportunity to present *Ghost Ranger*.

While the Pink Trombone website is intended as more of an interactive educational experience than an instrument, *Songs for Pink Trombone* is MULE's execution of a common practice in music technology - exploring the musical affordances of "non-musical" devices and applications and repurposing them in a musical context.
